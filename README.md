### This is my first project on here. <br> I am reinforcing how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this porject.

The project is a recipe book in which CRUD functionality is implemented to allow recipes to be added and deleted on local storage. This program works by creating a list of a custom HTML element that has multiple fields that hold recipe information.
